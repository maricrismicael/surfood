            <h1><b>Every plate of leftovers discarded is a missed opportunity to nourish and sustain those in need.</b></h1>
            <p>Our company made SurFood as an innovative e-commerce platform dedicated to
                selling surplus products and goods sourced directly from suppliers, drawing
                inspiration from the concept of dumpster diving. By utilizing SurFood, businesses
                can significantly reduce their food waste footprint, while individuals can access
                high-quality surplus goods at incredibly affordable prices.</p>

            <h1><b>How we help?</b></h1>
            <p>Through SurFood businesses can minimize the amount of food waste they produce
                by allowing people to avail their surplus goods at a much lower price. <br><br>
                In 2017, 2 million kilograms of food wastes were being produced daily in the capital
                city of the Philippines alone in which restaurants and food businesses are the
                second largest contributors next to households. <br><br>
                Stores of partnered companies of SurFood nationwide, will be available in the
                website in which consumers can purchase products that are 20% less than its
                original price. 75 percent of the total revenue goes to the partnered companies
                while the remaining percentage goes to SurFood.
