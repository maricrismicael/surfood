            <h1><b>Why does it matter?</b></h1>
            <p>Approximately one-third of all food produced worldwide, equivalent to about 1.3 billion metric tons, is wasted annually. 
               This wastage occurs throughout the entire food supply chain, from production and processing to distribution and consumption. 
               The vision of SurFood is to turn these numbers into opportunities for the companies to turn their loss into profit, and for low income families to avail food at a lower price.</p>

            <h1><b>Global Food waste</b></h1>
            <p>
                The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that over 33 percent of the world's food production is lost or wasted annually. 
                Food Navigator's data highlights that Asia accounts for 50% of global food waste, with half of this waste originating from South and Southeast Asia. 
                This significant amount of food waste contributes to emissions losses through multiple channels, including the release of methane and CO2 during food decomposition, as well as wasted emissions during transportation and production processes. 
                Even the disposal of leftovers from individual kitchens plays a role in exacerbating the issue.

            <h1><b>Environmental Impact</b></h1>
            <p>Food waste contributes to environmental degradation. When food decomposes in landfills, 
               it produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Moreover,
               food waste squanders valuable natural resources like water, energy, and land that were used in
               its production. <br><br>
               By reducing food waste and the associated resource consumption, the Surfood project helps mitigate environmental impacts. 
               It promotes sustainable consumption practices by redirecting surplus food into the market, reducing the need for additional production and the associated environmental footprint. 
               This contributes to the conservation of biodiversity, preservation of ecosystems, and reduction of carbon emissions.

            <h1><b>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</b></h1>
            <p>
                When food is wasted, we squander not only the food itself but also the energy and water resources invested in its growth, harvesting, transportation, and packaging. 
                Furthermore, when discarded food ends up in landfills and decomposes, it emits methane, a greenhouse gas even more potent than carbon dioxide. 
                If we were to cease wasting food, approximately 6%-8% of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions could be mitigated. 
                To put this into perspective, in the United States alone, the production of lost or wasted food generates greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to that of 32.6 million cars.

            <h1><b>Economic Impact</b></h1>
            <p>The economic cost of food waste is substantial. It is estimated to be around $1 trillion globally each year.
                This includes expenses related to production, transportation, storage, and disposal of wasted food. <br><br>
                The Surfood project offers financial benefits to both consumers and companies. 
                Consumers can access surplus food items at discounted prices, potentially lowering their grocery bills and increasing their purchasing power. 
                Companies, on the other hand, can recoup some of their costs by selling surplus inventory instead of incurring losses through disposal. 
                This economic efficiency can have positive ripple effects within local economies.

            <h1><b>Hunger and Food Insecurity</b></h1>
            <p>
                Wasted food necessitates energy, land, water, and labor throughout its lifecycle, en-compassing production, storage, harvesting, transportation, packaging, and sales. 
                By discarding food, we are squandering valuable resources that could have been utilized to nourish people in need. 
                With approximately 700 million individuals globally experiencing undernourishment, providing them with sufficient food would not only alleviate hunger but also contribute to GDP growth. 
                Conversely, we currently waste around seven billion tons of food annually. Food waste occurs at various stages of production, distribution, and consumption. 
                Notably, the percentage of food wastage is most significant in lower and upper-middle-income countries.

            <h1><b>Household Food wastes</b></h1>
            <p>
                Household food waste, which pertains to edible food discarded by individuals or families at home, constitutes a significant portion of the overall food waste issue. 
                Although it may appear inconsequential at an individual level, the cumulative effect of household food waste is substantial. Numerous factors contribute to this waste. 
                One prominent factor is inadequate meal planning and portion control, as individuals frequently acquire or prepare more food than necessary, leading to surplus that is ultimately wasted. 
                Furthermore, a lack of awareness regarding proper food storage and preservation techniques can result in premature spoilage and the disposal of still-edible items.

            <h1><b>Retail and Hospitality sectors</b></h1>
            <p>
                The primary sources of food waste in developed countries such as the U.S. are supermarkets, restaurants, and consumers. 
                Supermarkets contribute to food waste by promoting excessive purchases, maintaining excessive inventory, inaccurately estimating product shelf life, and mishandling products. <br><br>
                Similarly, the hospitality industry, which includes restaurants, hotels, and other foodservice providers, also plays a significant role in food waste generation. 
                In restaurants, wastage occurs due to leftover food on plates, excessive portion sizes, and inefficient kitchen practices. All-you-can-eat establishments and buffet setups often lead to unnecessary food preparation and subsequent disposal. Within hotels, events like banquets, room service, and breakfast buffets can result in substantial food waste if proper planning and portion control measures are not in place.
